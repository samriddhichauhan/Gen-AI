# Gen-AI Experiments 🚀

This folder contains my personal experiments, projects, and practice code related to **Generative AI (Gen-AI)**, including:

- Working with **Hugging Face models**
- Building small **chatbots**
- Trying out **text generation**, **fine-tuning**, and **AI/ML concepts**

It is mainly a **learning and exploration space** where I test different ideas in AI and Machine Learning.

## 📂 Folder Purpose

The **Gen-AI** folder is used to:

- Organize all my Gen-AI related scripts and notebooks in one place  
- Practice:
  - loading models from **Hugging Face**
  - generating text
  - basic fine-tuning
- Build small demo projects for:
  - college
  - hackathons
  - personal learning

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

Some examples of things this folder may contain:

- `tiny_gpt2_chat.py`  
  A simple terminal chatbot using a tiny GPT-2 model from Hugging Face.

- Experiment scripts for:
  - text generation  
  - trying different models (e.g. GPT-2, DistilGPT-2, DialoGPT, etc.)  
  - playing with parameters like `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`

- Future:
  - notebooks for **fine-tuning models**  
  - simple **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** experiments  
  - small Gen-AI projects (study assistants, Q&A bots, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The code in this folder may use:

- **Python 3**
- **PyTorch** (`torch`)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (`transformers`)
- Optionally:
  - `datasets` for training or fine-tuning
  - `accelerate` for faster training (later)

To install basic dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
